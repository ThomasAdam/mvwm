<section id='quoting'>
<title>Quoting</title>

<para>Quotes are required only when needed to make fvwm consider two or
more words to be a single argument.  Unnecessary quoting is
allowed.  If you want a quote character in your text, you must
escape it by using the backslash character.  For example, if you
have a pop-up menu called "Window-Ops", then you do not need
quotes:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Popup"/> Window-Ops
</programlisting>

<para>but if you replace the dash with a space, then you need
quotes:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Popup"/> "Window Ops"
</programlisting>

<para>The supported quoting characters are double quotes, single quotes
and reverse single quotes.  All three kinds of quotes are treated
in the same way.  Single characters can be quoted with a preceding
backslash.  Quoting single characters works even inside other
kinds of quotes.</para>

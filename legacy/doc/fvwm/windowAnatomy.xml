<title>Anatomy of a Window</title>

<para>Fvwm puts a decorative border around most windows.  This border
consists of a bar on each side and a small L-shaped section on
each corner.  There is an additional top bar called the title-bar
which is used to display the name of the window.  In addition,
there are up to 10 title-bar buttons.  The top, side, and bottom
bars are collectively known as the side-bars.  The corner pieces
are called the frame.</para>

<para>With the built-in minimal configuration, dragging mouse button 1
in the frame or side-bars begins a resize operation on the window.
Dragging mouse button 2 in the frame or side-bars begins a move
operation.  There are raise/lower operations bound to a single
clicking on borders.  Similarly for the window title.</para>

<para>Up to ten title-bar buttons may exist.  Their use is completely
user definable.  One popular configuration uses one button on the
left that is used to bring up a list of window options and two
buttons on the right used to iconify and maximize the window.
Another popular configuration adds a close button to the right.
The number of title-bar buttons used depends on which ones have
mouse actions bound to them.  See the
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>
command.</para>

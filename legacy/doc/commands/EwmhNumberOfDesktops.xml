<para>This command is useful only for an ewmh compliant pager or taskbar
(as kpager or kicker taskbar) and not for fvwm modules (
<fvwmref mod="FvwmPager"/> or <fvwmref mod="FvwmIconMan"/>). It causes a
compliant application to consider at least
<replaceable>num</replaceable>
desktops (desktop 0 to desktop
<replaceable>num</replaceable>-1).
The optional argument
<replaceable>max</replaceable>
causes a compliant application to never consider more than
<replaceable>max</replaceable>
desktops. If
<replaceable>max</replaceable>
is 0 (the default) there is no limitation.  The actual number of
desktops is determined dynamically.  It is at least
<replaceable>num</replaceable>,
but it can be d if there is a window on desktop d-1 (or if the
current desktop is desktop d-1) and d is less or equal to
<replaceable>max</replaceable>
or
<replaceable>max</replaceable>
is null.
Moreover, a compliant pager can ask to change
<replaceable>num</replaceable>
itself.
This is accepted by fvwm only if this number is
less than or equal to
<replaceable>max</replaceable>
or if
<replaceable>max</replaceable>
is null.  Note that negative desktops are not supported by the
ewmh specification.  The default is 4 0.</para>

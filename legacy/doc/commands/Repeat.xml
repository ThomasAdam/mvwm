<para>When the
<emphasis remap='B'>Repeat</emphasis>
command is invoked, the last command that was executed by fvwm is
executed again.  This happens regardless of whether it was
triggered by user interaction, a module or by an X event.
Commands that are executed from a function defined with the
<fvwmref cmd="Function"/>
command, from the
<fvwmref cmd="Read"/> or
<fvwmref cmd="PipeRead"/>
commands or by a menu are not repeated.  Instead, the function,
menu or the
<fvwmref cmd="Read"/> or
<fvwmref cmd="PipeRead"/>
command is executed again.</para>

<para>Specifies a colon separated list of directories in which to search
for images (both monochrome and pixmap).  To find an image given
by a relative pathname, fvwm looks into each directory listed in
turn, and uses the first file found.</para>

<para>If a directory is given in the form "/some/dir;.ext", this means
all images in this directory have the extension ".ext" that should
be forced.  The original image name (that may contain another
extension or no extension at all) is not probed, instead ".ext" is
added or replaces the original extension.  This is useful, for
example, if a user has some image directories with ".xpm" images
and other image directories with the same names, but ".png"
images.</para>

<para>The
<replaceable>path</replaceable>
may contain environment variables such as
<envar>$HOME</envar> (or <envar>${HOME}</envar>).
Further, a '+' in the
<replaceable>path</replaceable>
is expanded to the previous value of the path, allowing appending
or prepending to the path easily.</para>

<para>For example:</para>

<programlisting>
ImagePath $HOME/icons:+:/usr/include/X11/bitmaps
</programlisting>

<para>Note: if the
<fvwmref mod="FvwmM4"/>
module is used to parse your
<filename>config</filename>
files, then m4 may want to mangle the word "include" which
frequently shows up in the
<emphasis remap='B'>ImagePath</emphasis>
command.  To fix this one may add</para>

<programlisting>
undefine(`include')
</programlisting>

<para>prior to the
<emphasis remap='B'>ImagePath</emphasis>
command, or better: use the
<option>-m4-prefix</option>
option to force all
<emphasis remap='B'>m4</emphasis>
directives to have a prefix of "m4_" (see the
<fvwmref mod="FvwmM4"/>
man page).</para>

<para>A number of commands require a window to operate on.  If
no window was selected when such a function is invoked the user is
asked to select a window.  Sometimes this behavior is unwanted,
for example if the function was called by a module and the window
that was selected at first does not exist anymore.  You can
prevent this by putting
<emphasis remap='B'>Silent</emphasis>
in front of the fvwm
<replaceable>command</replaceable>.
If a function that needs a window is called with
<emphasis remap='B'>Silent</emphasis>
without a window selected, it simply returns without doing
anything. If
<emphasis remap='B'>Silent</emphasis>
is used on a user defined function it affects all function and sub
function calls until the original function exits.</para>

<para>Another usage of
<emphasis remap='B'>Silent</emphasis>
is with binding commands
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/>, <emphasis remap='B'>PointerKey</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='B'>Mouse</emphasis>,
this disables error messages.</para>

<para><emphasis remap='B'>Silent</emphasis>
also disables the error message for non-existent commands.  Note:
This command is treated as a prefix to its
<replaceable>command</replaceable>.
Expansion of the command line is done as if
<emphasis remap='B'>Silent</emphasis>
was not there.</para>

<para>Examples:</para>

Silent <fvwmref cmd="Move"/> 0 0
Silent User_defined_function
# do not complain on keyboards without "Help" key
Silent <fvwmref cmd="Key"/> Help R A <fvwmref cmd="Popup"/> HelpMenu

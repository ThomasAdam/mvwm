<para>Warps the cursor to the associated window.  The parameters
<replaceable>x</replaceable> and <replaceable>y</replaceable>
default to percentage of window down and in from the upper left
hand corner (or number of pixels down and in if
'<fvwmopt cmd="WarpToWindow" opt="p"/>'
is appended to the numbers).  If a number is negative the opposite
edge is used and the direction reversed.  This command works also
with windows that are not managed by fvwm.  In this case fvwm does
not bring the window onto the screen if it is not visible.  For
example it is possible to warp the pointer to the center of the
root window on screen 1:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="WindowId"/> root 1 WarpToWindow 50 50
</programlisting>

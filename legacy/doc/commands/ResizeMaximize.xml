<para>Combines the effects of
<fvwmref cmd="Resize"/>
and
<fvwmref cmd="Maximize"/>
in a single command.  When used on a maximized window, the window
is resized and is still in the maximized state afterwards.  When
used on an unmaximized window, the window is resized and put into
the maximized state afterwards.  This is useful if the user wants
to resize the window temporarily and then return to the original
geometry.  The
<replaceable>resize-arguments</replaceable>
are the same as for the
<fvwmref cmd="Resize"/>
command.</para>

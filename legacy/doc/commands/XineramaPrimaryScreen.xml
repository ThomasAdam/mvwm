<para>Takes an integer number or 'g' or 'c' as its argument.  A number
is taken as the number of the Xinerama screen that is to be used
as the primary screen.  The primary screen can be used as the
preferred screen to place windows with</para>

<para>The primary screen is used in some of the modules and for the
default icon box too.  Any number that is zero or more is taken as
the primary screen's number.  Instead, the letter 'c' indicates to
use the current screen (containing the pointer) whenever the
primary screen is used.  This may be very confusing under some
circumstances.  With 'g', the global screen is used as the primary
screen, effectively disabling the primary screen.  Calling this
function with any other argument (including none) resets the
primary screen to 0.</para>

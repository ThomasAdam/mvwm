</cmdsynopsis>

<para>Causes fvwm to record a mouse stroke sequence and to execute the
corresponding action as defined in a
<fvwmref cmd="Stroke"/>
command.  The cursor is modified to the
<fvwmref cmd="CursorStyle" opt="STROKE"/>
context of the
<fvwmref cmd="CursorStyle"/>
command during recording.  When the stroke is finished
<emphasis remap='B'>StrokeFunc</emphasis>
looks for a stroke binding of the form</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Stroke"/> sequence 0 Context Modifiers action
</programlisting>

<para>and executes the corresponding action (Note the 0).  Normal use of
this function is via a
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> or
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/>
command.  Examples:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 3 A M StrokeFunc
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/> x R N StrokeFunc
</programlisting>

<para>If you press mouse button 3 and
<keysym>Alt</keysym>
anywhere (respectively, press the key x when the cursor is on the
root window), then fvwm records the mouse motions until the mouse
button 3 (respectively, the x key) is released and then check if
the recorded
<emphasis remap='I'>sequence</emphasis>
corresponds to a stroke binding of the form</para>

<programlisting>
"Stroke <replaceable>sequence</replaceable> 0 A M <replaceable>action</replaceable>"
"Stroke <replaceable>sequence</replaceable> 0 R N <replaceable>action</replaceable>"
</programlisting>

<para>Note that the
<replaceable>Context</replaceable> and <replaceable>Modifiers</replaceable>
are taken at the beginning of the execution of the
<emphasis remap='B'>StrokeFunc</emphasis>
command (so you can release the modifiers before the end of the
stroke recording in the case of a mouse binding and if you used,
say, a title-bar context the mouse motion can go through an
application window).  The keys
<keysym>Escape</keysym> and
<keysym>Delete</keysym>
allow you to abort the command.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='B'>StrokeFunc</emphasis>
command has five options:
<emphasis remap='I'>NotStayPressed</emphasis>, <emphasis remap='I'>EchoSequence</emphasis>, <emphasis remap='I'>DrawMotion</emphasis>, 
<emphasis remap='I'>FeedBack</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>StrokeWidth</emphasis>.
These options are disabled by default.
<fvwmopt cmd="StrokeFunc" opt="EchoSequence"/>
causes fvwm to Echo the recorded stroke sequence.
<fvwmopt cmd="StrokeFunc" opt="DrawMotion"/>
causes fvwm to draw the mouse motion on the screen.
<fvwmopt cmd="StrokeFunc" opt="FeedBack"/>
causes fvwm to display during a fraction of second the cursor of
the
<fvwmref cmd="CursorStyle" opt="WAIT"/>
context of the
<fvwmref cmd="CursorStyle"/>
command if the recorded stroke sequence corresponds to a stroke
binding.
<fvwmopt cmd="StrokeFunc" opt="StrokeWidth"/>
takes an integer argument, which must be &gt;= 0 and &lt;= 100 and which
defines the width of the line for the
<emphasis remap='I'>DrawMotion</emphasis>
option.</para>

<para>
<fvwmopt cmd="StrokeFunc" opt="NotStayPressed"/>
works only if
<emphasis remap='B'>StrokeFunc</emphasis>
is used via a
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>
or a
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/>
command.  This option removes the need to have a button or the key
pressed during the stroke, but you have to do a mouse click or
press the
<keysym>Return</keysym>
or
<keysym>Space</keysym>
key to finish the mouse motion recording (these keys also work
without the
<emphasis remap='I'>NotStayPressed</emphasis>
option).</para>

<para>You can use the
<emphasis remap='B'>StrokeFunc</emphasis>
"alone".  In this case it works as above with the
<emphasis remap='I'>NotStayPressed</emphasis>
option enabled.  However,
<replaceable>Modifiers</replaceable>,
in general, may not work as expected (i.e., in this case use 'A'
or 'N' as
<replaceable>Modifiers</replaceable>
in the stroke bindings).</para>

<para>Note that some computers do not support key release events. If
that is the case the
<emphasis remap='B'>StrokeFunc</emphasis>
used via a
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/>
command works as if the
<emphasis remap='I'>NotStayPressed</emphasis>
option is enabled.</para>

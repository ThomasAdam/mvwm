	<command>DestroyStyle</command

		><replaceable>style</replaceable
	></arg>
</cmdsynopsis>

<para>deletes the style named
<replaceable>style</replaceable>.
The changes take effect immediately.  Note that
<replaceable>style</replaceable>
is not a wild-carded search string, but rather a case-sensitive
string that should exactly match the original
<fvwmref cmd="Style"/>
command.</para>

<para>Destroying style "*" can be done, but isn't really to be
recommended. For example:</para>

<programlisting>
DestroyStyle Application*
</programlisting>

<para>This removes all settings for the style named "Application*", NOT
all styles starting with "Application".</para>

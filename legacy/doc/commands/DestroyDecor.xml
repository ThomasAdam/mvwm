<para>This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future.  There
are plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.</para>

<para>Deletes the
<replaceable>decor</replaceable>
defined with
<emphasis remap='B'>AddToDecor</emphasis>,
so that subsequent references to it are no longer valid.  Windows
using this
<replaceable>decor</replaceable>
revert to the "Default" decor. The optional parameter
<fvwmopt cmd="DestroyDecor" opt="recreate"/>
tells fvwm not to throw away the decor completely but to throw
away only its contents. If the decor is created again later,
windows do not use it before the
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="UseDecor"/>
style is applied again unless the decor was destroyed with the
<emphasis>recreate</emphasis>
option.  The decor named "Default" cannot be destroyed.</para>

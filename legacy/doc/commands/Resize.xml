<para>Allows for resizing a window.  If called from somewhere in a window
or its border, then that window is resized.  If called from the
root window then the user is allowed to select the target window.</para>

<para>The operation can be aborted with <keysym>Escape</keysym> or by pressing
any mouse button (except button 1 which confirms it).</para>

<para>If the optional arguments
<replaceable>width</replaceable> and <replaceable>height</replaceable>
are provided, then the window is resized so that its dimensions
are
<replaceable>width</replaceable> by <replaceable>height</replaceable>.
The units of
<replaceable>width</replaceable> and <replaceable>height</replaceable>
are percent-of-screen, unless a letter
'<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="p"/>'
is appended to one or both coordinates, in which case the location
is specified in pixels.  With a
'<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="c"/>'
suffix the unit defined by the client application (hence the c) is
used.  So you can say</para>

<programlisting>Resize 80c 24c</programlisting>

<para>to make a terminal window just big enough for 80x24
characters.</para>

<para>If the
<replaceable>width</replaceable> or <replaceable>height</replaceable>
is prefixed with the letter
'<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="w"/>'
the size is not taken as an absolute value but added to the
current size of the window.  Example:</para>

<programlisting>
# Enlarge window by one line
Resize keep w+1c
</programlisting>

<para>Both,
<replaceable>width</replaceable> and <replaceable>height</replaceable>
can be negative.  In this case the new size is the screen size
minus the given value.  If either value is "<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="keep"/>", the
corresponding dimension of the window is left untouched.  The new
size is the size of the client window, thus</para>

<programlisting>Resize 100 100</programlisting>

<para>may make the window bigger than the screen.  To base the new size
on the size of the whole fvwm window, add the
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="frame"/>
option after the command.  The options
<emphasis remap='I'>fixeddirection</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>direction</emphasis> and
<emphasis remap='I'>warptoborder</emphasis>
are only used in interactive move operations.  With
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="fixeddirection"/>
the same border is moved even if the pointer moves past the
opposite border.  The
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="direction"/>
option must be followed by a direction name such as "NorthWest",
"South" or "East" (you get the idea).  Resizing is started
immediately, even if the pointer is not on a border.   If the special option
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="automatic"/> is given as a direction argument, then
the direction to resize is calculated based on the position of the pointer in
the window.  If the pointer is in the middle of the window, then no direction is
calculated.

The <fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="warptoborder"/>
option can be used to warp the pointer to the direction indicated.  As with the
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="automatic" /> option for
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="direction" />, the border to warp to is
calculated based on the pointer's proximity to a given border.  Also, if
resizing is started by clicking on the window border, the pointer
is warped to the outer edge of the border.</para>

<para>An alternate syntax is used if the keyword
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="bottomright"/> or in short
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="br"/>
follows the command name.  In this case, the arguments
<replaceable>x</replaceable> and <replaceable>y</replaceable>
specify the desired position of the bottom right corner of the
window.  They are interpreted exactly like the
<replaceable>x</replaceable> and <replaceable>y</replaceable>
arguments of the
<fvwmref cmd="Move"/>
command.  Actually, any of the options accepted by the
<fvwmref cmd="Move"/>
command can be used.</para>

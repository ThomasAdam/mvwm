* Requirement for Translators and developers: gettext-0.11.5
   
     http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

  Read the doc. However, the logic used is a bit different
  than the gettext logic

* For translators:

  Contact fvwm-workers@fvwm.org


* For programmers:

  To be written


* For creating a new catalogs, say LL_CC (e.g., fr, zh_CN):

  - Edit configure.in and add LL_CC to ALL_LINGUAS
  - run autoconf and ./configure (with your usual options) and check that
    the new "lang" appear in the list of "lang"
        Locale msg:  prefix/share/locale   ... LL_CC ...
  - cd to po/
  - create a domain.LL_CC.po file for all files domain.pot:
      
      msginit -i fvwm.pot -l LL_CC -o fvwm.LL_CC.po
      msginit -i FvwmTaskBar.pot -l LL_CC -o FvwmTaskBar.LL_CC.po
      ...

    The --no-translator option can be useful under certain situation
    (e.g., you do not use the LL_CC locale). In this case you should
    edit the files you have created and in particular set the
    appropriate CHARSET.

  - Then, you can start the translation of fvwm.LL_CC.po,
    FvwmTaskBar.LL_CC.po ...etc
    
    NOTE: You should "make domain.LL_CC.gmo" before make install
          and test your translation visually!

* make:

    - make [all] should do nothing (but, maybe, recreating the
      Makefile). "make install" install! But see the previous NOTE.

    - The following (re)build everything (safe):

      make po-update

    - If some messages have changed in some source files in "domain":
    
       make domain.pot-update

      update domain.pot. Then you can
       
       make domain.LL_CC.po

      to get the new messages for translation. After translation:

       make domain.LL_CC.gmo   # create a binary mo file from the po one
       make install
       restart fvwm
      
      for visual testing.

    - Other targets:
      
      make update-gmo  # build all the binary gmo files

* Creation of a new domain: ask the fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.

   Basically:

    - Update ALL_DOMAINS in configure.in
    - Add NEW_DOMAIN in configure.in
    - Create po/$NEW_DOMAIN.pot (xgettext) and add it to EXTRA_DIST
      (todo: remove this step)
    - Set the files which contains msg NEW_DOMAIN = file1 file2 ...
      in the beginning of po/Makefile.am
    - Add $(srcdir)/$(NEW_DOMAIN).pot: and $(NEW_DOMAIN).pot-update:
      in po/Makfile.am
    - Update $(POFILES): and update-po: in po/Makfile.am
      (todo: remove this step)

* New instructions, Feb 19, 2013 (Dan Espen):
    - Got .po files from contributor.
    - Change configure.ac to add X to ALL_LINGUAS.
    - Generate .gmo files by doing:
      make fvwm.X.gmo FvwmScript.X.gmo FvwmTaskBar.X.gmo
      where X is the language.

.SH NAME
MvwmConsole \- an mvwm command input interface

.SH SYNOPSIS
Module MvwmConsole [options]

\fIMvwmConsole\fP can only be invoked by mvwm.
Command line invocation of the \fIMvwmConsole\fP module will not work.

.SH DESCRIPTION
MvwmConsole allows the user to type mvwm configuration commands
interactively, and have them executed immediately.  This tool is
particularly useful for testing new configuration ideas, or for
implementing temporary changes to your environment.

.SH INVOCATION
MvwmConsole must be spawned as a module by mvwm.  MvwmConsole takes all
\fIxterm\fP(1) options.
.PP
MvwmConsole can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module MvwmConsole' in
the .mvwm2rc file.  This can be placed on a line by itself, if
MvwmConsole is to be spawned during mvwm's initialization, or can be
bound to a menu or mouse button or keystroke to invoke it later.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
MvwmConsole uses \fIxterm\fP(1).  All resources set for xterm are
inherited unless overridden by command line options.

.RS
Module MvwmConsole -g 40x10 -fg black -bg green3
.RE

A different terminal emulator can be specified with the -terminal
option.  However, only terminal programs that understand the options
-name, -title and -e can be used.

.RS
Module MvwmConsole -terminal rxvt
.RE

Previous versions of MvwmConsole supported a -e option to choose a
different front-end.  Although this option is still provided for
backwards compatibility its use is discouraged unless you know
exactly what you are doing.

.RS
Module MvwmConsole -e MvwmConsoleC.pl
.RE

(see \fIMvwmConsoleC.pl\fP(1)).
.PP
Also X resources can be set in your ~/.Xdefaults file:

.RS
MvwmConsole*VT100*geometry: 40x4
.br
MvwmConsole*font: 7x14
.RE


.SH "COMMAND EDITING"

There are a few options.  If the GNU readline library is available, it
can be used.
.PP
If Perl5 is installed, MvwmConsoleC.pl can be used as a command editor.
This can be accomplished by either copying MvwmConsoleC.pl
to mvwmlib directory as MvwmConsoleC or
invoking MvwmConsole with -e option.
For example:

.RS
Module MvwmConsole -e MvwmConsoleC.pl
.RE

If neither one is installed, a simple input reading function which
doesn't have editing capabilities is used.
.P
GNU readline and MvwmConsoleC.pl have some frequent used commands
in common as default.
These commands are similar to emacs.
For more details, refer GNU readline man and info pages, and
MvwmConsoleC.pl man page.

.SH EXITING

MvwmConsole can be stopped by entering the EOF character (usually CTRL-D).
.PP
\fBNote!\fP Do not use the "quit" command, as this is an mvwm builtin:
typing "quit" at the MvwmConsole command line will cause mvwm to exit.

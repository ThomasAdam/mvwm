.SH NAME
MvwmIdent \- the Mvwm identify-window module
.SH SYNOPSIS
MvwmIdent is spawned by mvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The MvwmIdent module prompts the user to select a target window, if
the module was not launched from within a window context in Mvwm.
After that, it pops up a window with information about the window
which was selected.

.SH COPYRIGHTS
The MvwmIdent program, and the concept for
interfacing this module to the Window Manager, are all original work
by Robert Nation and Nobutaka Suzuki.

Copyright 1994, Robert Nation and Nobutaka Suzuki. No guarantees or
warranties or anything
are provided or implied in any way whatsoever. Use this program at your
own risk. Permission to use this program for any purpose is given,
as long as the copyright is kept intact.


.SH INITIALIZATION
During initialization, \fIMvwmIdent\fP gets config info from \fBmvwm\fP's
module configuration database (see
.IR mvwm (1),
section
.BR "MODULE COMMANDS" )
to determine which colors and font to use.

If the MvwmIdent executable is linked to another name, ie ln -s
MvwmIdent MoreIdentify, then another module called MoreIdentify can be
started, with a completely different configuration than MvwmIdent,
simply by changing the keyword  MvwmIdent to MoreIdentify. This way multiple
clutter-reduction programs can be used.

.SH INVOCATION
MvwmIdent can be invoked by binding the action 'Module MvwmIdent'
to a menu or key-stroke in the .mvwm2rc file.  Mvwm will search
directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option to
attempt to locate MvwmIdent. Although nothing keeps you from
launching MvwmIdent at start-up time, you probably don't want to.
Clicking into the MvwmIdent window or pressing a key while it
has focus closes MvwmIdent. Pressing mouse button 2 in the window
restarts MvwmIdent and asks for a new window to select.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
MvwmIdent reads the same .mvwm2rc file as mvwm reads when it starts up,
and looks for lines as listed below:

.IP "*MvwmIdent: Colorset \fIn\fP"
Tells the module to use colorset \fIn\fP. See MvwmTheme.

.IP "*MvwmIdent: Fore \fIcolor\fP"
Tells the module to use \fIcolor\fP instead of black for text. Switches off the
Colorset option.

.IP "*MvwmIdent: Back \fIcolor\fP"
Tells the module to use \fIcolor\fP instead of white for the window
background. Switches off the Colorset option.

.IP "*MvwmIdent: Font \fIfontname\fP"
Tells the module to use \fIfontname\fP instead of fixed for text.

.IP "*MvwmIdent: MinimalLayer \fIlayer\fP"
MvwmIdent places its window on the layer of a target window. But not
below the minimal layer. By default, the minimal layer is 4 just like
the mvwm default layer. If \fIlayer\fP is 0, the layer of the target
window is always used. If \fIlayer\fP is "default" or not specified,
the default behavior is restored. If \fIlayer\fP is "none", MvwmIdent
is placed as a normal window even if the target window is above it.

FvwmCommand is an interface to send commands to and receive
information from Fvwm2 from processes which are not Fvwm modules.


Examples

  test1.pl      - takes 1 argument  't' to invoke FvwmTalk
                                    'td'  to kill FvwmTalk
                                    ''  to move windows
  test2.sh      - takes 1 argument  'b'  to invoke FvwmButtons
                                    'kb' to kill FvwmButtons
                                    'r'  to change # of button rows
                                    'c'  to change # of button columns
  ex-auto.pl    - auto raise small windows. It will keep them visible.
  ex-cascade.pl - cascade windows, then move them back.
  ex-grpmv.pl   - choose a group of windows to move together.

  Above examples are not meant to be practical but to show how it can
  be done.



  focus-link.pl
     This is a user programmable window focus script.
     Default behavior is:
      1. When a window is opened up, focus the window and move the pointer
         to it. The parent window regains focus when a window is closed.
         Parenthood is determined when a window is opened. It is the last
         focused window with the same X class.
      2. #1 would not occur to AcroRead opening window.
      3. #1 would not occur when SkipMapping is set and the window is the
         only window of its class.
      4. For Netscape find dialog window, addition to #1, resize the window
         to 300x150 pixels and move it to East edge of the screen.
         Download/upload windows will not be focused nor be in focus link
         list.
      5. Move appletviewer to NorthWest corner.
      6. Xterm won't focus back to its parent after closed.
      7. When a window is de-iconified, focus it and move the pointer.

  focus-Netscape.pl
      Focuses pop-up windows, such as 'open URL' or 'find' whenever
      opened up. This let the user to type in immediately without
      moving mouse. This script also moves 'download' window to the
      right edge to keep it visible. If this is invoked from
      .fvwm2rc, use as:

          AddToFunc "StartFunction" "I" Module  FvwmCommandS
          + "I" Exec $HOME/scripts/focus-Netscape.pl

  push-away.pl <direction> <window name>
      Pushes windows away to avoid overlapping. use as:

          push-away.pl up 'Fvwm Pager'

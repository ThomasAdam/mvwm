  Fixed bugs in reading and writing FIFOs.

  Will not exit after bad messages.

  Server keeps track of connection to client to avoid sending
  unnecessary messages.

  Handle multiple (long) commands correctly.

  Added lock mechanism to avoid connecting multiple FvwmCommand
  to a FIFO. 

  Added focus-link.pl script and its manpage.

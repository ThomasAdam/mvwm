Horribly out of date see the fvwm bug site at www.fvwm.org

These bugs are not fixed, if you think you can help, do so.

Known bugs as of FvwmButtons-080396:

*  There has also been reported problems with buttons hanging forever after
   being pressed.

 * Some swallowed windows crash when resized very small. Their problem.

Known bugs as of FvwmButtons-070396:

 * Action commands are supposed to work also on swallowed windows, but there
   is a problem with X. After reparenting, XSelectInput is called with a mask
   including ButtonPressMask|ButtonReleaseMask, but evidently no buttonpresses
   are received, even though the program (like xload) doesn't use them for
   itself. So where is the bottleneck? Send the solution if you got it.
   OK, so I need to do SubstructureRedirectMask, and shuffle all the events
   onwards... really? No better way? Mmm..

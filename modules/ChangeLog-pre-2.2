	MvwmCommand.pm.

Sat Mar 13 11:52:39 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MvwmCommand/INSTALL: removed obsolete file.

	SHAPE not defined; problem noted by Fabien Villard.

1999-03-12  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* MvwmTaskBar/ButtonArray.c (ButtonDraw): If we didn't have enough
	room to write _any_ of the title on the button (if there are
	_lots_ of buttons) then we'd get into an infinite loop as
	search_len is not checked to make sure it stays >0.  Make that
	check.  Note we don't test to see if the "..." itself will fit; I
	suspect you could get buttons small enough that the "..." will
	overwrite some of the button.  Oh well, at least it doesn't freeze up.

1999-03-11  Dominik Vogt  <dominik(dot)vogt(at)gmx(dot)de>

Wed Mar 10 22:55:43 1999  DanEspen  <dje@blue>

	* MvwmForm/ReadXServer.c (ToggleChoice): You can now paste multiple
 	lines into a form.  If the form contains buttons activated by
 	the Return Key the paste can activate the button.

	* MvwmForm/.FormMvwmTalk.: Changed the built-in form to reset the
	command field on Return key, necessary for pasting many lines to
 	look right.  Not the best for typing a line at a time, there is
	no feedback.  Pasting lots of config lines at once works well.

1999-03-09  Andrew T. Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* MvwmRearrange/MvwmRearrange.c: Add GPL header and reformat some
	code.

1999-03-03  Johan Bengtsson  <johanb@DoCS.UU.SE>

	* MvwmPager: Introduced a well defined order between specific desk
 	pixmap, specific desk colour, global pixmap and global colour, when
 	choosing the background of a desk. They are chosen in the order
 	they are mentioned above. In order to do this, the Dcolor and
	bgPixmap fields in the desk structure are now only used if the
	desk has been assigned a specific colour or pixmap.

	Introduced an option to disable hilighting of the current desk.

	* MvwmPager/MvwmPager.1
	Added sections for the new configuration options.

	* MvwmPager/MvwmPager.c:

 	made a small update to how the label colours are treated.
	(ParseOptions): Added new options and updated the Back and Pixmap
	options to only update the global background not the desk specific
	backgrounds.

	* MvwmPager/x_pager.c:
	(initialize_pager): Introduced the new ordering of backgrounds.
	(DrawIconGrid): Introduced some machinery to make the feature of
	having different backgrounds on different desks work in icon mode
	as well. Introduced machinery for disabling hilight in icon mode.

1999-03-02  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* MvwmAnimate/MvwmAnimate.c: Remove fonts and colors from
	customization form.  These can now be set globally by MvwmForm.
	Second try, removed another color spec.

1999-03-02  Steven Michael ROBBINS  <stever@hojpoj.cs.mcgill.ca>

	* MvwmEvent/MvwmEvent.c: Finished the removal of Parse.c and
	Parse.h from MvwmEvent.

	* MvwmWinList/MvwmWinList.c (RedrawWindow): add XFlush() call in
	RedrawWindow(), for VMS port.  Ifdef this if it causes problems.

	* MvwmPager/MvwmPager.c (My_XNextEvent): allow bypassing the test
	for too many missed XEvents; needed for VMS port.

	the data files need to be explicitly listed for EXTRA_DIST.

1999-02-28  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>

	* MvwmEvent/Makefile.am (MvwmEvent_SOURCES: Remove Parse.c and
	Parse.h, use the corresponding functions from libs/ModParse.c.

Sun Feb 28 11:49:24 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

Sat Feb 27 11:55:27 1999  DanEspen  <dje@blue>

	* MvwmForm/ReadXServer.c: Add logic to allow international
	characters, bug id 179.

1999-02-26  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* MvwmForm/MvwmForm.c:
 - Removed form limitations including:
   number of lines in a form.
   number of items in a form.
   number of items in a line.
   number of selections in a choice.
   number of commands on a button.
   Colors can be changed anywhere in a form.
   Fonts can be changed anywhere in a form.

 - Changed the general organization of the module to match MvwmAnimate.
   See comments in MvwmAnimate to see what it mimicks.
   Some parts of this module have comments containing "MvwmAnimate"
   are common module/macro candidates.
   Changed debugging technique to match MvwmAnimate with the
   additional ability to Debug to File.

 - Configurability updates:
   Form appearance can be configured globaly:
   Form defaults are read from .MvwmForm.
   There is a built in Default setting/saving dialogue.
   Forms can be read in directly from a file.
   The file is the alias with a leading dot.
   The file is in $HOME or the system configuration directory.
   Comes with forms installed in the system configuration directory.

 - Operability:
   You can tab to previous input field with ^P, Up arrow, shift tab.

 - This module now has a configuration proceedure:
   AddToMenu "Module-Popup" "MvwmForm Defaults" MvwmForm FormMvwmForm

 - Use MvwmAnimate command parsing.
   The part of the command after the module name is no longer case sensitive.
   Use command tables instead of huge "else if".

 - Misc:
   Avoid core when choice not preceeded by a selection.
   Rename union member "select" so it doesn't conflict with the function.
   You can now control vertical spacing on text.  By default text is spaced
   vertically the way you would want it for buttons.
   This is for compatibility.  Now you can change the spacing to zero as
   you might want for a help panel.
   A button can execute a synchronous shell command.  The first use I
   put this is a form that writes its new definition to a file and
   reinvokes itself.
   Use SendText instead of writes to pipe.
   Changed button press-in effect from 1 sec to .1 sec.  Didn't seem to
   do anything on a slow machine...
   Added preload arg, and Map, Stop and UnMap commands for fast forms.
   (MvwmForm is now parsing commands during form display.)
   Add "Message" command, display "Error" and "String" messages from mvwm.
   Removed CopyNString, strdup replaces it.

1999-02-25  Johan Bengtsson  <johanb@DoCS.UU.SE>

	* MvwmPager: Added configuration options; Pixmap,
	DeskPixmap, HilightPixmap, LabelsBelow, LabelsAbove, ShapeLabels,
	NoShapeLabels.

	* MvwmPager/MvwmPager.c:
 	(main): Added initialisation of picture handling from mvwmlib.
        (list_new_desk): If a pixmap background is defined for a desk it
	is installed instead of a background colour. Now the label colour is
	updated according to the used desk.
	(ParseOptions): Added code to read IconPath and PixmapPath from
	the configuration file.
	  Added code to recognise the new configuration options and
        NoStartIconic.

	* MvwmPager/MvwmPager.h:
 	(desk_info): Added field bgPixmap, to keep track of background
	pixmap of this specific desk. Removed unused fields x and y.
	(pager_string_list): Added field bgPixmap to keep track of
	background pixmap for this specific desk.

	* MvwmPager/x_pager.c:
	(initialize_pager): Added test that turn off ShapeLabels if the X
 	server don't support shape extensions.
  	  If a pixmap background is defined for a desk it is installed
        instead of a background colour.
	  If a hilight pixmap is defined, it is used instead of a hilight
	colour.
	(UpdateWindowShape): Added a function adding a shape mask,
	containing the defined desks and the label of the current desk, to
	the pager window if ShapeLabels is on.
	(DrawGrid): Modified to hilighting code to turn off hilighting of
 	the label of the current desk if ShapeLabels is on.
          Modified the label drawing code to draw the desk label below the
	desk if LabelsBelow is on
	  Added call to UpdateWindowShape at the end of the function.

	* MvwmPager/MvwmPager.1: Added sections for the new
	configuration options.

	the pointer.

1999-01-17  Chris Rankin  <rankinc@bellsouth.net>

	* MvwmWinList/ButtonArray.c (UpdateButton): Use saferealloc().
	* MvwmWinList/MvwmWinList.c: ShutMeDown turned into an
	exit-procedure (installed via atexit).
	SIGPIPE and SIGTERM now set a global flag which breaks the event
	loop, rather than exiting directly.
	Event loop restyled after MvwmIconMan, which is neater and simpler.
	Signals installed with sigaction (if present).
	If no sigaction, then use signal & siginterrupt (BSD 4.3).
	If no siginterrupt then just bang a couple of rocks together.
	Added "const" and function attributes to a select few prototypes.
	Loose malloc turned into safemalloc.
	* MvwmWinList/Mallocs.c (saferealloc): saferealloc() fixed.
	* MvwmWinList/Mallocs.h: Removed duplicate mvwmlib prototype

1999-01-02  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* MvwmButtons/MvwmButtons.c (Loop): Deleting panels doesn't delete

	GCC __attribute__ feature for more error checking.

1998-12-15  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	redrawing by Nadim Saeed

1998-12-13  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* MvwmButtons/draw.c (RedrawButton): fixed background pixmap for
	swallowed windows. Is it ok to never draw a background for swallowed
	applications?

	* MvwmIconMan/mvwm.c (destroy_window): coredump fixed: IconMan died
	when the window with the focus was deleted and the focus was changed

	* MvwmButtons/parse.c (ParseContainer):
	(match_string): fixed possible coredump (font_string == NULL but
	b_Font was still set).

1998-12-12  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* MvwmPager/x_pager.c (initialize_pager): fixed bug: balloons were

	deiconify this was right.

	* MvwmPager/MvwmPager.c (ParseOptions): *MvwmPagerBalloons Icon/Pager
	did not switch off the other type if both were used.

	* MvwmPager/x_pager.c (MapBalloonWindow): fixed possible coredump (t
	referenced but NULL)
	(MapBalloonWindow): OK, bug #49 is now really fixed. Although the
	mentioned Enter/Leave Notify loop is not handled, the balloon window
	should never overlap the application window in the pager, so there is
	no real need to do this.

1998-12-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* MvwmPager/x_pager.c (SwitchToDeskAndPage):
	(DispatchEvent): patch to make desk changing via button 3 work.
	(MapBalloonWindow): fixed bug #49 (balloon window off-screen)
	I'm a bit concerned because of a possible loop that is mentioned in
	the code when the y offset of the ballon window is zero. This might
	happen now again.

1998-12-08  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	a parameter.  Thes test for "table != e" was incorrect.  Only try

	identical to the function already available in libmvwm.  Renamed
	the static GetNextToken() to internal_GetNextToken() to avoid
	compiler warnings (a non-static version exists in libmvwm).

	* MvwmEvent/Makefile.am (LDADD): Added rplay_LIBS.
	* MvwmEvent/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added rplay_CFLAGS.

	* MvwmAudio/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added rplay_CFLAGS.

1998-11-05  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	SETVBUF_REVERSED.

	* MvwmTaskBar/Makefile.am (INCLUDES):

	* MvwmDebug/Makefile.am (INCLUDES):

	xpm.h is included by mvwmlib.h.

1998-11-04  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.bellcore.com>

	* MvwmAnimate/MvwmAnimate.c: Fixed bug where AnimateResizeLine was
	drawing 5 segments when it only wanted 4.

Ancient past:

 * Mvwm Event ChangeLog

 * added *MvwmEventPassID config option

 * renamed & cleaned up so that MvwmEvent (TaDa !!) is a general event
   handler module.
	       -- 21.04.98 Albrecht Kadlec (albrecht@auto.tuwien.ac.at)

 * changed parsing to use new library functions

 * merged bug fix from Christophe MARTIN <cmartin@ipnl.in2p3.fr>
     - MvwmAudio doesn't read messages it is not interrested in,
       thus desynchronize,
     - keep time stamp even if no sound is played
     - minimize malloc/free

   mark boyns ok-ed this patch, I reviewed it and put out those ugly
   #defines for RESYNC and READ_BODY by reordering the control structures
	       -- Albrecht Kadlec (albrecht@auto.tuwien.ac.at)

 * made MvwmAudio insensitive to its name -> can be symlinked.
   corrected some error message deficiencies, code for quoted 'sound'
   parameters shamelessly stolen from MvwmButtons/parse.c (with minimal
   adjustments)
   MvwmAudio now supports rsynth's say command:
   *MvwmAudioPlayCmd say
   *MvwmAudio add_window           "add window"
   *MvwmAudio raise_window         'raise window'
	       -- 08/07/96 Albrecht Kadlec (albrecht@auto.tuwien.ac.at)

 * Fixed MvwmAudio to reflect the changes made to the module protocol.

 * Szijarto Szabolcs <saby@sch.bme.hu> provided MvwmSound code that used
   $HOSTDISPLAY for the rplay host.  The code has been added to MvwmAudio.

 * Fixed bugs reported by beta testers, thanks!

 * Builtin rplay support has been added to MvwmAudio.  This support is
   enabled when MvwmAudio is compiled with HAVE_RPLAY defined and when
   MvwmAudioPlayCmd is set to builtin-rplay.  I guess it's safe to say
   that MvwmSound is now obsolete. -- Mark Boyns 5/7/94

 * MvwmAudio is based heavily on an Mvwm module "MvwmSound" by Mark Boyns
   and the real credit for this really goes to him for the concept.
   I just stripped out the "rplay" library dependencies to allow generic
   audio play command support.

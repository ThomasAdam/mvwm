Here's a very brief list of things on my immediate radar. -- Thomas Adam

* Code auditing/security:
    - Remove SAFEFREE() macro;
    - Add xasprintf() to libs/safemalloc.[ch]
    - Audit xmalloc() use and consider xasprintf() wrapper
    - Look at current code warnings at compilation and fix
		- CFLAGS containing -Wextra must be fixed.

* Code cleanup needed!
    - Don't use typedefs for structs:
        - Opaqueness is not useful here!
            - 'struct foo' versus 'foo_t' or 'Foo' as the type.
            - Will allow for reducing the number of structs used as the main
              API, and will allow for better streamlining and accessing.
        - There's a lot of macro #defines for accessing struct members,
          presumably to hide the type; that's usually OK, but I'd like to
          see these go away.  FW and Decor are good examples of this!  I'd
          rather see more exposed functions to replace these.  The API will
          need discussion.
    - What's in libs/ -- the static linking of libfvwm.a useful anymore?
      There's a lot of code being ripped out of libs/ and I don't see much
      more being added in.

* String handling!
    - libs/String.[ch] and friends have idioms like CatString3, and
      other means to manipulating strings.  Get rid of these.
    - Audit the code for strcpy()/strcat(), and take out back and shoot
      them!  Specifically:
        - Check whether the original string is being malloc()d and just use
          xasprintf()
        - If it's on the stack, use strlcpy(), and carefully consider
          whether the return value should be checked.  If it's not
          necessary, add (void) at the start of the call.
    - Each command shouldn't be doing its own string parsing; the items
      should be tokenised before-hand and sent along to the relevant CMD_*()
      functions.
        - This means rethinking how commands/lines/etc., are parsed.

* liblfg as a configuration file framework?
    - http://liblcfg.carnivore.it/
	- Likely too inflexible; build own parser from YACC?

* Separate desktops per monitor:
	- PanWindows per-monitor inhibit moving windows across screen
	  boundaries.  Have a key-binding to stop panning?

* Clients:
    - Have an "undo" list of geometries which can be reverted to.
    - Per-page geometries for windows, makes handling sticky windows easier.
    - No special-casing of maximised state, it's just another geometry set
      which is added on to a list, and popped when no longer used in that
      state.

* Documentation (Being worked on:  https://github.com/Hoodoo/mvwm-docs):
    - It's broken; as I'm removing code I'm not removing the documentation!

* Commands:
    - There's wayyy too many commands in FVWM:
        - Too many duplicates; merge.
            - And hence consider those commands to be authoritative and with
              many options.
        - Think about a common way of referring to pages/windows/etc -- much
          like with tmux's "-t session:window.pane" syntax, can we not do
          something similar here for referring to pages/windows?
	- Handling of command options:
		- Commands don't do their own parsing; instead, command tokens are
		  parsed with getopt(), and a tree of key/values are built; that
		  tree is passed in, and referenced arg_has()/arg_get(), etc.

* Functions / Conditionals / Exec (PipeRead) / Etc.:
        - Next/Prev/etc., are all very scripting-like.  Do we just want hook
          support?  Is it worth expanding FvwmEvent to do this?

* Modules:
    - The module interface (FVWM <-> Module) is a mess; consider DBUS?  Or
      imsg?
    - Use libevent to replace the hand-rolled (and often broken) select/poll
	  mechanism.
    - What about third-party scripting languages?  How do we handle that
      without requiring linking against the specific language in question?
    - FvwmPager with per-monitor broken:  the module needs to be
      screen-aware.
	- Amalgamation of module(s) is a possibility:
		- Functionality for things like buttons, taskbars, iconman, pager,
		  etc., can be replaced with a single module:
			- Combines all the functionality of the obsolete modules.
			- Uses colorsets consistently, to allow configuring all GUI
			  elements.
			- Can be reconfigured at runtime through user interactions (e.g.
			  dragging elements to a different position on the window)
			- Initially support the older module interface.
			- Can replace all the old modules with symlinks.
